# What's that ?

Animware is a 3D animation software written in java.

There are a few features in it:
- A 3d object displayer with rotations and scale included
- A timeline with previz
- An export module for generating images from viewport

A few hours ago, I decided to rewrite entirely my code with a new idea. Because I now understand how to make 3d graphics from scratch (see v1), I will continue my work with the OpenGL API.

In this case, I'm working on a second version of my work (see v2) powered by OpenGL through the JOGL/Gluegen frameworks from JogAmp.

The V1 will remain available to show my evolution during time !

# What's next ?

##currently on V2

Remake the software with a cleaner architecture with the OpenGL APIs with the exact same features that I implemented in V1.

##Ideas from V1 (deprecated)

Actually a cube is integrated into the code. That's why i'm working on import and export module for JSON 3d objects.
I absolutly need to implement a lighting module.
Actually, the viewport and the camera are the same entity. But I'm working on a dynamic cam system.
In a near future, I want to integrate a very simple rigging and skeletal animation system. It would be amazing !
Animware means Animation Software.

# Who made this

My name is William, and I'm a developper interested about the collision points between arts and technologies. I'm learning 3D graphics because I love to create [Animations and motion pictures](https://www.youtube.com/@Griffure) and I needed to understand how it works.
I create Animware as a solo dev.
