# What's that ?

Animware is a 3D animation software written in java.

There are a few features in it:
- A 3d object displayer with rotations and scale included
- A timeline with previz
- An export module for generating images from viewport

# What's next ?

Actually a cube is integrated into the code. That's why i'm working on import and export module for JSON 3d objects.
I absolutly need to implement a lighting module.
Actually, the viewport and the camera are the same entity. But I'm working on a dynamic cam system.
In a near future, I want to integrate a very simple rigging and skeletal animation system. It would be amazing !
Animware means Animation Software.
